# Introduction to GRASS

[GRASS](https://github.com/palumbom/GRASS) is Julia library designed to produce realistic stellar spectra with time-variable granulation signatures. Based on real observations of the Sun, GRASS is a first-of-its-kind simulation tool which does not rely on magnetohydrodynamic simulations to produce its spectra.

The documentation for GRASS provides instructions for installation and examples for a few basic and advanced use cases. Please reference the GRASS paper for an in-depth review of the motivation and implementation of GRASS.
